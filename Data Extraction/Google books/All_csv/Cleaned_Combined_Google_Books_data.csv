Climate Justice in a Non-ideal World,Jennifer Clare Heyward & Dominic Roser,Oxford University Press,climate change is a pressing international political issue for which a practical but principled solution is urgently required climate justice in a nonideal world aims to make normative theorising on climate justice more relevant and applicable to political realities and public policy the motivation behind this edited collection is that normative theorising has something to offer even in an imperfect world mired by partial compliance and unfavourable circumstances in the last years a lively debate has sprung up in political philosophy about nonideal theory and there has also been an upsurge of interest in the various normative issues raised by climate change such as intergenerational justice transnational harm collective action or risk assessment however there has been little systematic discussion of the links between climate justice and nonideal theory even though the former would seem like a paradigm example of the relevance of the latter the aim of this edited volume is to address this in doing so the volume presents original work from leading experts on climate ethics including several who have participated in climate policy the first part of the book discusses those facets of the debate on climate justice that become relevant due to the shortcomings of current global action on climate change the second part makes specific suggestions for adjusting current policies and negotiating procedures in ways that are feasible in the relatively short term while still decreasing the distance between current climate policy and the ideal the chapters in the third and final part reflect upon how philosophical work can be brought to bear on the debates in climate science communication and politics,Climate_justice

Climate Realism,Lynn Badia & Marija Cetinic & Jeff Diamanti,Routledge,this book sets forth a new research agenda for climate theory and aesthetics for the age of the anthropocene it explores the challenge of representing and conceptualizing climate in the era of climate change in the anthropocene when geologic conditions and processes are primarily shaped by human activity climate indicates not only atmospheric forces but the gamut of human activity that shape these forces it includes the fuels we use the lifestyles we cultivate the industrial infrastructures and supply chains we build and together these point to the possible futures we may encounter this book demonstrates how every weather event constitutes the climatic forces that are as much social cultural and economic as they are environmental natural and physical by foregrounding this fundamental insight it intervenes in the wellestablished political and scientific discourses of climate change by identifying and exploring emergent aesthetic practices and the conceptual project of mediating the various forces embedded in climate this book is the first to sustain a theoretical and analytical engagement with the category of realism in the context of anthropogenic climate change to capture climates capacity to express embedded histories and to map the formal strategies of representation that have turned climate into cultural content,climate_change

Urbanism in the Age of Climate Change,Peter Calthorpe,Island Press,cities are green is becoming a common refrain but calthorpe argues that a more comprehensive understanding of urbanism at the regional scale provides a better platform to address climate change in this groundbreaking new work he shows how such regionally scaled urbanism can be combined with green technology to achieve not only needed reductions in carbon emissions but other critical economies and lifestyle benefits rather than just providing another checklist of new energy sources or one dimensional land use alternatives he combines them into comprehensive national growth scenarios for  and documents their potential impacts in so doing he powerfully demonstrates that it will take an integrated approach of land use transformation policy changes and innovative technology to transition to a low carbon economy to accomplish this calthorpe synthesizes thirty years of experience starting with his ground breaking work in sustainable community design in the  following through to his current leadership in transitoriented design regional planning and land use policy peter calthorpe shows us what is possible using real world examples of innovative design strategies and forwardthinking policies that are already changing the way we live this provocative and engaging work emerges from calthorpes belief that just as the last fifty years produced massive changes in our culture economy and environment the next fifty will generate changes of an even more profound nature the book enhanced by its superb fourcolor graphics is a call to action and a road map for moving forward,climate_change
