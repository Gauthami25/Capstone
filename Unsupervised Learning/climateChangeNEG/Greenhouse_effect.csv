"The popular K&amp;T atmospheric energy balance does not balance when real data is used. With real data, there is no greenhouse effect, and increased infrared absorbing gases (which also have increased emissivity, as physics shows) lead to a cooling of the atmosphere by increased emission to space.",climateskeptics
Is there a point to building a cold frame on existing outdoor veggie patch? It only adds 5-10 degrees of temperature increase vs the ambient. We don't get that much sun to get the full greenhouse effect. Thinking of building me one but wondering if the rest of you find it useful.,pnwgardening

Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere… 95% of greenhouse effects come from water vapor… CO2 only amounts to 3.6%… humans produce 0.28% of the CO2 in the atmosphere… human impact on greenhouse effects is so small it is barely measurable… yet WEF wants you to believe there is a “climate crisis”…,Wallstreetsilver
